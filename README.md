# 🎟️ People-Counter-in-Theater_0710
This is a simple web application that allows you to count and save the number of people entering a theater. The design is themed with a background image of a theater for immersive visual context.


## Features
- Count the number of people with a click
- Save current count to a history log
- Automatically reset count after saving
- Theater-style UI with clean overlay styling


## How It Works
- Clicking **INCREMENT** adds 1 to the counter.
- Clicking **SAVE**:
  - Appends the current count to the "History entries"
  - Resets the count to 0
